## Introduction
Welcome to the Exploitation Techniques Handbook. This repository provides an overview of various exploitation techniques used in cybersecurity. Each section explains the technique, its purpose, and how to defend against it. 

## Buffer Overflow
Attackers manipulate a program's memory by overflowing a buffer to execute arbitrary code or crash the program.

## SQL Injection
Injecting malicious SQL queries into input fields to manipulate a database, potentially gaining unauthorized access.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Injecting malicious scripts into web applications, which can then run in the context of an unsuspecting user's browser.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Forcing a user to perform actions on a web application without their knowledge or consent.

## Privilege Escalation
Exploiting vulnerabilities to elevate one's privileges from a lower user role to a higher one, often gaining admin rights.

## Malware
Using malicious software to infect systems and steal data, encrypt files for ransom, or create botnets.

## Phishing
Deceiving users into providing sensitive information, often by impersonating trusted entities through email or websites.

## Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
Intercepting communication between two parties without their knowledge, potentially altering or eavesdropping on the data.

## Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
Overwhelming a system or network with traffic to make it unavailable to users.

## Social Engineering
Manipulating individuals into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.

## Zero-Day Exploits
Targeting previously unknown vulnerabilities in software or hardware before developers can release patches.

## Session Hijacking
Stealing an active user's session token to impersonate them and gain unauthorized access.

## Clickjacking
Creating an invisible overlay on a legitimate website to trick users into performing unwanted actions.

## DNS Spoofing/Poisoning
Redirecting or altering DNS responses to redirect users to malicious websites.

## Brute Force Attacks
Repeatedly attempting different combinations to guess passwords or encryption keys.

## File Inclusion
Exploiting weaknesses in a web application to include files from a remote server, potentially executing malicious code.

## Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Exploiting vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on a remote system.

## Side-Channel Attacks
Exploiting unintended information leakage, like timing or power consumption, to infer cryptographic keys.

## Evasion Techniques
Employing methods to evade detection by security tools, such as antivirus or intrusion detection systems.

## Drive-By Downloads
Forcing users to download and execute malicious files when visiting a compromised website.

## USB-Based Attacks
Spreading malware or compromising systems via infected USB drives or peripherals.

## Watering Hole Attacks
Targeting websites that a specific group or organization frequently visits, infecting those users.

## Ransomware: 
Encrypting a user's files and demanding a ransom for their release.

## Rootkits: 
Concealing malware in the kernel of an operating system, making it challenging to detect.

## Physical Attacks
Physically accessing systems or devices to compromise security, steal data, or install malware.

## IoT Exploitation
Targeting vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) devices to gain access or control.

## Blockchain Exploits
Attacking the security of blockchain networks or smart contracts.

## Insider Threats
Exploiting access privileges of an organization's own employees or trusted entities.

## Race Conditions
Manipulating the timing of events to exploit a vulnerability in a program or system.

## Memory Corruption
Manipulating or corrupting memory to execute arbitrary code or take control of a system.

## Conclusion
This repository is a valuable resource for understanding and defending against various exploitation techniques. Cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts can use this information to bolster their knowledge and protect against potential threats.
